Attempts to identify a cat who we call Katja from an uploaded image using a
fastai deep learning model.

#### Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD.
#### Oâ€™Reilly Media.

There are four classification categories:

`(Maine Coon, cat, isKatja, random thing)`

Please refer to `src/public/python/isKatja.ipynb` for more information regaring
how the model was trained and what data it used to train with.

Specifically, this model is biased in classifying pictures that I have taken of
cats as images of Katja. The images for the other categories are scraped from
google image search, which tend to include head-on, professional portraits of
cats as opposed to the blurry photos of Katja sleeping curled up on a blanket.
Time has not been spent on finding the right opposing data set.
